# Movie Theater

## Rules

On a high-traffic weekend, a user accesses the movie booking platform to reserve seats for a popular film.
They navigate the available showtimes, choose preferred seats, and initiate the booking process. The system swiftly
confirms the reservation and delivers digital tickets to the user.  

Behind the scenes, the platform seamlessly orchestrates seat availability, monitors screening schedules, and calculates
ticket pricing—all in real time—to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

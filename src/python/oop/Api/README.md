Bookstore API—a classic domain with enough complexity to cover:

•  CRUD operations
•  Pagination
•  Filtering and sorting
•  Authentication and authorization
•  Caching
•  Error handling
•  HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
•  Headers and metadata
•  Rate limiting (optional)
•  Async I/O and background tasks

REST Design Principles We'll Apply
🧭 Naming & Structure
• 	Use plural nouns for resources (, )
• 	Nest related resources ()
• 	Use HTTP methods appropriately:
• 	 → list books
• 	 → create a book
• 	 → retrieve one
• 	 → full update
• 	 → partial update
• 	 → delete
📦 Response Codes
• 	 for successful reads
• 	 for successful creation
• 	 for successful deletion
• 	 for validation errors
• 	 /  for auth issues
• 	 for missing resources
• 	 for schema validation
🔍 Pagination & Filtering

•
📘 HATEOAS
Include links in responses:

🛡️ Error Handling
Use FastAPI’s , custom exception handlers, and validation via Pydantic.
🧠 Headers & Metadata
• 	Use  for caching
• 	,  for rate limiting
• 	 headers for client-side caching
🚀 Performance & Caching
• 	Use  for shared logic
• 	Redis or in-memory cache for frequently accessed data
• 	Background tasks for async operations (e.g., sending confirmation emails)

üîß Distributed Systems & Architecture
1. What is the CAP theorem, and how does it apply to system design?
CAP stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. In distributed systems:
- Consistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- Availability: Every request receives a response.
- Partition Tolerance: The system continues to operate despite network failures.
You can only fully achieve two of the three. For example, in Kafka, partition tolerance is a must, so you often trade between consistency and availability.

1. How would you design a system for high availability and fault tolerance?
- Use redundant components (multi-zone, multi-region).
- Implement health checks, failover, and replication.
- Use load balancing (e.g., ALB, NGINX).
- Apply retry logic, circuit breakers, and backoff strategies in services.
- Monitor with Prometheus/Grafana to detect failures early.

1. How does event-driven architecture scale better than request-response?
Event-driven systems are loosely coupled:
- Services publish events; others subscribe and react.
- Use of Kafka or Azure Event Hubs allows for async processing, horizontal scaling, and resilience during load spikes.

1. What are idempotent operations and why are they crucial in distributed systems?
Idempotent operations can be repeated without changing the result. They‚Äôre vital to ensure:
- Safe retries in case of timeouts or errors.
- Consistent state across microservices and APIs.

1. How would you mitigate distributed system failures?
- Use timeouts, retries, and bulkheads.
- Add chaos testing (e.g., Chaos Monkey).
- Apply observability through structured logging and metrics.
- Design services with graceful degradation paths.

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Architecture & DevOps
6. What are best practices for cloud cost optimization?
- Use autoscaling, spot instances, and reserved capacity.
- Right-size VMs and containers.
- Archive unused storage and enable lifecycle policies.
- Monitor with cost dashboards (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer).

7. How would you plan a cloud migration for a legacy application?
- Assess readiness via 6R model (Rehost, Refactor‚Ä¶).
- Use phased migration: data > app > services.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for new cloud builds.
- Monitor performance post-migration and optimize.

8. How do you secure cloud-native applications?
- Use IAM roles and least privilege access.
- Apply encryption at rest and in transit.
- Use managed secrets (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).
- Implement WAFs, DDoS protection, and audit logs.

9. Difference between service mesh and API gateway?
- API Gateway: Ingress control, authentication, rate limiting.
- Service Mesh (e.g., Istio): Internal service-to-service traffic management, observability, retries, mTLS.
They complement each other in microservice architectures.

10. What‚Äôs your approach to designing scalable APIs?
- Versioning (/v1/products)
- Pagination and filtering
- Cacheable responses (using ETag)
- Use of OpenAPI for documentation
- Async pattern for long-running jobs via Webhooks or event queues

üê≥ Docker & Kubernetes
11. What are Kubernetes RBAC best practices?
- Use ServiceAccounts and scoped roles.
- Follow least privilege: no wildcards unless necessary.
- Separate dev/test/prod permissions.
- Audit and rotate RBAC policies regularly.

12. How do you manage secrets securely in Kubernetes?
- Use Secrets with encryptionProviders (e.g., KMS)
- Avoid exposing secrets via env
- Consider external stores like Vault
- Use namespaces and RBAC to scope access

13. What‚Äôs the difference between ConfigMaps and Secrets?
- ConfigMaps: Non-sensitive config (e.g., app flags)
- Secrets: Base64-encoded sensitive data Both can be mounted as files or injected via env.

14. What‚Äôs a sidecar container and when do you use it?
Runs alongside a main container to:
- Log, monitor, or proxy traffic (e.g., Envoy for Istio)
- Inject secrets or configs dynamically
- Extend functionality without modifying app code

15. What are key strategies for multi-cluster Kubernetes?
- Centralized observability and logging
- Federation for global policies
- Network connectivity via VPN or service mesh
- Shared container registry and CI/CD with cluster targeting

üîê Security & Configuration
16. How do you manage TLS certificates across services?
- Use ACME protocol via cert-manager on K8s
- Automate renewals and monitoring
- Store certs securely in volumes or secret managers
- Offload TLS to ingress controller if appropriate

17. What‚Äôs your approach to dependency vulnerability management?
- Use tools like Trivy, Snyk, or Docker Scout
- Shift-left via CI scans
- Set up alerts for newly discovered CVEs
- Rotate builds and base images proactively

18. What‚Äôs a supply chain attack, and how do you defend against it?
An attacker compromises dependencies or build tools. Defense includes:
- SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials)
- Signed images (Notary/Venafi)
- CI pipeline isolation
- Runtime verification via policies (e.g., OPA, Kyverno)

19. How do you enforce secure configurations in CI/CD?
- Use Git hooks, pre-commit checks for secrets
- Scan Dockerfiles for root access or excessive layers
- Enforce linting and security benchmarks (CIS, OWASP)

20. What tools or patterns do you use for config drift detection?
- Terraform with state comparison
- ArgoCD/Kustomize drift detection
- Use CI to reconcile desired vs actual state
- Alerting for unauthorized config changes

üîÑ CI/CD, Observability & Troubleshooting
21. What‚Äôs your CI/CD pipeline structure for multi-service deployments?
- Build: Docker + image tagging
- Test: Unit, integration, security scans
- Deploy: Helm charts or kubectl via GitOps
- Promote across environments (dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod)
- Use feature flags for dynamic rollouts

22. How do you ensure fast and safe rollbacks?
- Versioned deployments with Helm or manifests
- Use blue/green or canary deployment strategies
- Monitor metrics for regressions
- Automate rollbacks with alerts or failure gates

23. How do you design for observability?
- Structured logging (e.g., JSON logs)
- Trace propagation via OpenTelemetry
- Metrics collection via Prometheus + Grafana
- Real-time dashboards, alerts, and anomaly detection

24. What‚Äôs your approach to log aggregation?
- Use FluentBit/Fluentd with Elasticsearch, Loki, or Splunk

# Vending Machine

**Topics:** `OOP`
**Solutions:** [`Python`](../../src/python/oop/VendingMachine) [`C#`](../../src/csharp/oop/VendingMachine)

## Rules

Picture yourself standing in front of a vending machine, hungry for a quick bite. You slip in some cash, tap the button for your favorite treat, and within moments, it lands in the tray below. If you’ve overpaid, the machine returns the exact change without a hitch. Behind the scenes, a well-orchestrated system is quietly at work—managing inventory, processing payments, and keeping operations seamless and efficient.

### C#

``` bash
dotnet run --project ./VendingMachine.csproj

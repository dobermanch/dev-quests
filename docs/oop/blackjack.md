## Rules

Blackjack, often referred to as "21", is a popular card game where players compete against the dealer. At the beginning of each round, players place their bets, and the dealer deals two cards to each participantâ€”including themselves. Players then assess their hands, aiming to reach a total as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Based on their hand, they choose to either "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
Once all players have acted, the dealer reveals their cards and continues drawing until reaching a minimum total of 17, at which point they must stand. Behind the scenes, the game handles the deck, monitors player decisions, ensures fair dealing, and updates balances accordingly.

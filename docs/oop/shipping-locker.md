# Shipping Locker System

**Topics:** `OOP`
**Solutions:** [`Python`](../../src/python/oop/ShippingLocker) [`C#`](../../src/csharp/oop/ShippingLocker) [`Go`](../../src/go/oop/ShippingLocker)

## Rules

You’ve just been notified that your online order has arrived at a nearby shipping locker. You make your way there, enter a secure access code, and with a soft click, the locker door swings open—your package waiting inside. Behind the scenes, the system has already handled locker availability, selected a compartment that fits your parcel perfectly, and orchestrated a frictionless pickup experience.

### C#

``` bash
dotnet run --project ./ShippingLocker.csproj
```

``` bash
dotnet test ./ShippingLocker.csproj
```

# Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

**Topics:** `OOP`

**Solutions:** [`C#`](../../src/csharp/oop/Atm)

## Rules

The ATM allows users to insert a card, enter a PIN, and choose actions like checking balance, withdrawing cash, or depositing funds. It quickly verifies credentials and processes the request. Behind the scenes, it communicates with the bank, handles transactions, and operates hardware components such as the card reader and cash dispenser.

## Build and Run

### C#

``` bash
dotnet test ./Atm.csproj
```

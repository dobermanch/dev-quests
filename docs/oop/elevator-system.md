# Elevator System

**Topics:** `OOP`
**Solutions:** [`Python`](../../src/python/oop/ElevatorSystem) [`C#`](../../src/csharp/oop/ElevatorSystem)

## Rules

Picture yourself in an office building with a fleet of identical elevators, all serving the same floors. You press the "up" or "down" button in the hallway, and one of them quickly arrives. Once inside, you choose your destination from the button panel, and the elevator smoothly carries you there. Behind the scenes, a smart control system orchestrates which elevator responds, efficiently handling requests and filtering out those that donâ€™t match the current direction of travel.

## Build and Run

### C#

``` bash
dotnet run --project ./ElevatorSystem.csproj
```

``` bash
dotnet test ./ElevatorSystem.csproj
```

### Python

``` bash
python main.py
```

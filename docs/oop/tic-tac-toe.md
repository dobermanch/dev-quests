## Rules

Tic-Tac-Toe is a timeless two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. Each player chooses a symbol—either "X" or "O"—and alternates turns placing their symbol in an empty cell. The objective is to form a straight line of three matching symbols, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends in a win when a player achieves this alignment, or in a draw if all nine cells are filled without either player succeeding

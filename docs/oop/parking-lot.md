# Parking Lot

**Topics:** `OOP`  
**Solutions:** [`C#`](../../src/csharp/oop/ParkingLot)  

## Rules

As a driver enters a crowded parking facility, they're issued a ticket at the gate. Navigating through the lot, they
locate a space that accommodates their vehicle's dimensions and proceed to park. Upon departure, the driver presents
the ticket, prompting the system to compute the parking fee. The spot is then marked as available for incoming vehicles.

Behind the scenes, the parking system intelligently assigns spaces based on vehicle size, logs entry and exit timestamps,
and updates real-time availability to ensure efficient turnover.

## Build and Run

dotnet run --project ./ParkingLot.csproj
